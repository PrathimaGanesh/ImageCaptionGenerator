# ImageCaptionGenerator
Imagecaptiongenerator is an ML model that generates captions fro the images .Its built using Resnet101,a Convolutional Neural Network which extracts the  image features that are passed as feature vector to LSTM[ Long short Term Memory]  for caption generation.
# Image Caption Generator

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is an **Image Caption Generator** that uses a deep learning model combining **ResNet101** (for feature extraction) and **LSTM** (for sequence generation). Given an input image, the model generates a relevant caption describing the image.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Extracts image features using **ResNet101**.
- Generates natural language captions using **LSTM**.
- Trained on a dataset of image-caption pairs.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
This project is trained on the **Flickr8k dataset which consists of images with multiple human-annotated captions.
